An open-source project for Roblox.

This is a application bult in python, Allowing you to launch roblox games from the terminal. This will not get you banned off roblox, as it only launches games.

## Using **TermiBlox**
Compiling it is not recommended, as it can mean slow times for launching it, It is advised to run it through [python](https://www.python.org/).

It is possible to list all the games available to be joined by their names, (stored at "%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\TermiBlox", in the json file). This file can be swapped out with presets, or for settings to be changed, or just to add/remove games, The possibilities are endless.

If the TermiBlox RPC Doesen't load at all, Please adjust your waittime key in the settings.json file. It checks for RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe and RobloxPlayerBeta.exe so it should be fine, though be warned. The default is 10 seconds. The disregardlauncher key says the amount of time until the launcher's presence is ignored as a way to exit roblox. It is used to detect if roblox has launched properly. The default is 10. 

## Features
* Just run it through the terminal!
* Support for Discord Rich Presence - Show's what game your in.
* No .ROBLOSECURITY Cookie needed, Just enter the GameID And have fun!
* File modification - Re-add the old death sound, Force future is bright and more!

## Changing the settings
Settings that are changed in the "settings.json" file are automatically read on the startup of [TermiBlox](https://github.com/Xulaari/TermiBlox). This defaults to [the termiblox github's settings.json file](https://github.com/Xulaari/TermiBlox/blob/main/settings.json). To access it, Press Windows+R or press windows for the start menu, and paste "%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\TermiBlox" (no quotes). You will be able to modify settings from there. It is also the same place where you can add games that you want.

# Inspiration
[Pizzaboxer](https://github.com/pizzaboxer) For the idea of the launcher in the first place.

[Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap) As I was able to find how the hell to launch a game from its code.. :skull:
